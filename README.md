- This is an example of how a web page built in frontend with vueJs can display data in a database by making API calls.

- With routes created in vueJS, we can move between pages, which will always make different calls.

- With the search form we can search for a project by name, with the select filter the type of project, and with the pagination scroll all the   results.

- The "contact us" section allows us to fill out a form that will send a warning email to the site administrator.

- With the ADMIN button we can, if logged in, enter the database management.
